## Nice to fix: 
- Push Notifications
    - Promoting New Issues
    - Promoting New Event
    - Promiting New Product or coupon code
    - Promoting Livestream or video content
- Issues
    - Put the paging for all the issues - we only have limit about 50 per page so we will need to have a way for user to view more. 
- Livestream: 
    - we are asking for user permission for camera and videos - need to deal with that soon. 
- Video: 
    - page for all videos
    - get the Bambuster livestream videos 
    - pull and API for all their YouTube and Facebook videos.
